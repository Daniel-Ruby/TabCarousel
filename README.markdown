Tab Carousel
============

A Chrome extension to help you keep tabs on info you want to monitor.  It's great for cycling through tabs on an external display, like a TV.

Installing
----------

Installation is simple:  download the .crx file from the downloads on GitHub.  Chrome will take it from there.

Tutorial
--------

TabCarousel is simple:  open tabs you want to monitor throughout the day, then click the toolbar icon.  To stop, click the icon again.

By default, TabCarousel will flip through your tabs every 15 s, reloading them every 5 min.  It's great on a unused display or TV.  Put Chrome in full-screen mode (F11, or cmd-shift-f on the Mac) and let it go.

If you want to change how often TabCarousel flips through your tabs, right click on the toolbar icon and choose "Options".

Example Uses
------------

On a HDTV that has a computer attached, open the NewRelic overivew (and Background Tasks, etc.) for each app you'd like to monitor.  Set NewRelic to kiosk mode for each page, then hit the "Tab Carousel" toolbar button.

The TabCarousel wiki has more.
