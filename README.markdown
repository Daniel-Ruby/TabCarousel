Tab Carousel
============

Tab Carousel is a Chrome extension that cycles through your Chrome tabs on an interval.

Click the toolbar button and Chrome will start rotating through your tabs every 10 seconds (by default).

Installing
----------

Carousel is currently in beta, so if you'd like to try it out, you'll have to install the unpacked extension:

* Download the zip, tar, or git clone this repo
* Extract the zip/tar archive, if necessary
* Open chrome://extensions in your browser
* Hit the "+" button on Developer Mode (on the right side of the page)
* Choose "Load unpacked extension..." and browse for the extracted files.

If it installed correctly, you'll see a new toolbar button.

This was originally written on Chrome 12.0.742.100 on Mac OS X 10.6.4.

Example Uses
------------

On a HDTV that has a computer attached, open the NewRelic overivew (and Background Tasks, etc.) for each app you'd like to monitor.  Set NewRelic to kiosk mode for each page, then hit the "Tab Carousel" toolbar button.
  
Note: New Relic automatically refreshes itself.  It's likely that a feature to force a refresh for other tabs will be added.
