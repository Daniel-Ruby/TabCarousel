Tab Carousel
============

Tab Carousel is a Chrome extension that cycles through your Chrome tabs on an interval.

Click the toolbar button and Chrome will start rotating through your tabs every 15 seconds (by default).

Installing
----------

Installation is simple: download the .crx file from the downloads on GitHub.  Chrome will take it from there.

Carousel is early in development.  I consider it to be beta software, although Chrome doesn't allow versions to be marked as such.

Example Uses
------------

On a HDTV that has a computer attached, open the NewRelic overivew (and Background Tasks, etc.) for each app you'd like to monitor.  Set NewRelic to kiosk mode for each page, then hit the "Tab Carousel" toolbar button.
  
Note: New Relic automatically refreshes itself.  It's likely that a feature to force a refresh for other tabs will be added.
